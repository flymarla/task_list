This App allows the user to create a to-do list.

## Description

* When a task is checked off it will change the font to strike-through.
* If a user hits the enter button they will be alerted to press tab or use the submit button

## How to Run

In order to run this program, first download the files to a folder, keeping file structure intact.
Next open a terminal window and change directory to the folder where the files were saved.  Install http-server in that folder with the command npm i http-server. Then start the server with the command http-server -c-O.  Next go to a browser and type the address localhost:8080.

Add items to the to-do list by typing them in the form input boxes.  Complete task by clicking on the task or the checkbox.

## Roadmap to Future Improvements

* Ability to delete unwanted tasks.
* Ability to edit tasks that have been submitted.
* Ability to clear to-do list completely.
* Ability to customize header and also add date.
